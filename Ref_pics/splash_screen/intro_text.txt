2337, evil coroporations around the world have taken the power. The free market has no limit. In order to maximize profit, those companies have found a very efficient way to dispose of all their nuclear and toxic wastes: throwing them into the sun.

Amongst the people of earth, a few remain lucid and see the unevitable coming. The fusion process happening naturally inside our star is getting accelerated. The sun will soon go nova.

Those people name themselves the Bee-Wariors, a reference to a now long extinct terrestrial animal. You are one of them. This is your duty to save the galaxy, flying through hyper-space in your bee-ship.

Eliminate all the flying wastes to prevent the sun from blowing up!
